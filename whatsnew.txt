Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5s .NET2 Edition - Feb 28 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- various MOB codec improvements
- added "NPC Generators" tab to the object editor, in order to support NPC monster
  generators. Generators are marked by the ONF_GENERATOR flag. Parameters of the
  generator should be set on the "NPC Generators" tab. The generator NPC will generate
  NPCs after a certain period of time.
- added support for "Scout Point" standpoint, which can be used to set up a
  location where NPC should run to if he senses danger.
- added support for obj_f_critter_gender and obj_f_critter_race.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5r .NET2 Edition - Feb 20 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- added the "Clean Inventory" button to both containers and NPCs. It allows to
  remove all items from the inventory with just one click. [Thanks to Cerulean
  the Blue for suggesting]
- added the "Delete" button to the "open MOB" screen, that allows to delete a
  mobile object from your hard disk drive. Note that right now it doesn't delete
  associated mobile objects, so you'll need to clean their inventories etc.
  manually first. [Thanks to Cerulean the Blue for suggesting]

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5q .NET2 Edition - Feb 10 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- corrected the subtile positions in tile structure (now they are correct)
- !!! IMPORTANT !!!: Rewrote the SVB support. Now the SVBs are supported by the
  sector analyzer and the sector painter as they should be. No more 3 layer
  mirroring or hard-to-predict coords, everything is 1:1.
- !!! IMPORTANT !!!: Updated the Sector Painter mode, added SVB overlay quick
  options. These options will allow to paint SVBed tiles OVER the existing tile
  configuration, so you can simply paint the blocking/flyover/etc. tiles first,
  and then paint SVB tiles OVER them without ruining the initial configuration
  of the tile.
- !!! IMPORTANT !!!: Removed support for SVBs in Editor's Assistant Tool (ed.py)
  because it was broken. There is no way I can implement SVBs in ed.py at the
  moment. If I'll think of a way to do it I'll definitely do it. For now, please
  use ToEEWB's Visual Sector Painter to paint SVBed areas.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5p .NET2 Edition - Feb 9 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

- included the "Fill from InvenSource" button for NPC and container inventories.
  Currently the only thing it doesn't support is jewelry. This function can be
  used to automatically fill the NPC/container's inventory (loot only) from an
  invensource.mes entry.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5o .NET2 Edition - Feb 8 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

- improved the MOB codec, now it loads and saves back Calmert without problems.
- added the "NPC Levelup Scheme" property to the list of supported MOB props
  (whatever it does).

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5n .NET2 Edition - Feb 6 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

- fixed and expanded the standpoint support. Now, standpoints are moved to
  NPC/Critters 2 tab of the object editor. X/Y offsets and Jump Point IDs
  are now supported. Also, standpoints that don't use jump points must now
  have their Jump Point ID fields set to -1.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5m .NET2 Edition - Feb 3 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

- added complete support for "NPC Factions" property in the MOB object editor.
  It's located on the new "NPC/Critters 2" tab of the object editor. It can be
  used to override the NPC factions from the protos.tab.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5l .NET2 Edition - Feb 1 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

- updated the visual sector analyzer/painter tool so it gives a detailed
  breakdown of SVB bits that are set for each tile (different colors are used
  for each of extend, end, base, and archway flags)

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5k .NET2 Edition - Feb 1 2006
-----------------------------------------------------

- fixed the Secret Door support!!! Now, the secret door DC will work correctly!
  You can use any value from 0 to 127 for DC, that should open new possibilities!
  Special thanks to Steve Moret for clarifications that helped me fix this!!!

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5j .NET2 Edition - Jan 30 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- fixed the positions of all secret door flags in the object editor.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5i .NET2 Edition - Jan 28 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- now the waypoint editor will show the selected waypoint properties when
  a waypoint is selected in the editor.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5h .NET2 Edition - Jan 27 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- not released to public. Internal release that was used to test certain
  possible future tweaks.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5g .NET2 Edition - Jan 27 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- added support for delay and rotation to NPC waypoints. Just use the
  corresponding fields to specify these parameters. A waypoint delay is how
  long the NPC should wait before proceeding to the next waypoint. Probably
  in milliseconds (e.g. 1000 = approx. 1 sec).

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5f .NET2 Edition - Jan 25 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- improved SVB support in the sector editor, made a much more detailed comment
  about meaning of SVB flags, and actually 'named' the SVB flags in the editor.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5e .NET2 Edition - Jan 24 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- improved the MOB codec so it will NOT corrupt the data in mobile objects'
  standpoints, substitute inventory container, and various other properties
  EVEN if the loaded MOB file has weirdly aligned waypoint structure in it.
  Also, improved the codec so it's able to parse more leftover properties
  without failing to load the mobile object.
- implemented the day/night transitions (daynight.nxd) file editor that can
  be used to specify MOBs that need to be in different places during the day
  and during the night.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5d .NET2 Edition - Jan 23 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- implemented a button to create particle system hash IDs in the light
  editor automatically.
- improved the MOB codec to support more MOB files.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5c .NET2 Edition - Jan 22 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- implemented the complete sector light editor with full support of all
  light types and properties. Use "Tools -> Sector Light Editor" (Ctrl+E)
  in order to launch it.
- the old "Lights" tab in the Sector Editor has been removed, so DON'T
  look for a light editor there! Use the tools menu instead.
- fixed the help menu for the animated waypoint IDs (thanks for pointing
  out my mistakes goes to Allyx).

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5b1 .NET2 Edition - Jan 21 2006
-------------------------------------------------------

- once again corrected the support for animated waypoints. Please check
  the "help" menu about the anim ids again.
- modified the global.lit editor to support all fields. Now, no more
  unknowns here.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5b .NET2 Edition - Jan 19 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- corrected and modified support for animated waypoints, now up to
  8 animations per waypoint are supported. Also, "long" anim IDs were
  shown incorrectly before (they aren't that "long" in fact :))
- added the new help menu concerning waypoint animation IDs that displays
  all known anim IDs that can be used for almost any object out there.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5a .NET2 Edition - Jan 17 2006
------------------------------------------------------

- added support for animated waypoints

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5 .NET2 Edition - Nov 27 2005
-----------------------------------------------------

- ported all of the code (except for the unused add-in system) to .NET 2.0
- considerably optimized the time it takes ToEEWB to perform different operations,
  including loading time (which now only takes 1-2 seconds to perform) and the
  2D graphics operations.
- made the application use Windows Visual Styles and Office 2003 style menus

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 5 - Sep 30 2005
---------------------------------------

- added the "Tolerance" option to the path node generator, allowing to set the
  maximum distance between the path nodes to generate links (see "Tolerance ->
  What is Tolerance?" in Path Node Generator for more information).

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 4 - Sep 29 2005
---------------------------------------

- this release should really be 1.8 or 2.0, but I'm a lazy bum to make all the
  necessary Co8 thread updates to update it to another major version :)))
- added a simple add-in system that will allow to plug in other programs into
  ToEEWB easily (to be used much more later).
- updated the Editor's Helper Script to version 5.1 (added the secloc command
  to find out the information about the current sector your character is in)
- added a path node editor/generator (support for pathnode.pnd files).
- added a new tutorial for using the path node generator.
- fixed some menu labels and some window texts.

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 3 - Sep 23 2005
---------------------------------------

- fixed a critical bug that caused the 2D map splitter to act incorrectly
  on certain irregular large maps

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 2 - Sep 23 2005
---------------------------------------

- updated ToEEFE Pro included in this package to version 3.1
- made a unified installation package including all changes since v1.7.1

Release v1.7 Patchlevel 1 - Sep 05 2005
---------------------------------------

- added some newly revealed protos.tab fields and clarified some of the previously
  unknown entries in protos.tab. Entries that were confirmed to be useless were
  marked as "Unused" instead of "Unknown".
- added descriptions to all movement opcodes in the world map path editor (will
  make things a LOT easier!)
- updated the Editor's Helper Script to version 5.0 (new version fixes a minor
  bug and also adds the SVB area painter).

Release v1.7 Final - Aug 20 2005
--------------------------------

- added the world map paths (worldmap_ui_paths.bin) editor.
- added some new properties to object editor.
- NOTE: from now on, ToEEWB is able to read almost every MOB file from the
  game. However, loading NPC MOBs can still mess things up, so PLEASE load
  the original game NPCs *only* for viewing, do NOT edit/save them back, or
  you risk corrupting a lot of things! You may also see some entries incorrectly,
  such as waypoints, standpoints, substitute inventory container.

Release v1.6 - Aug 14 2005
--------------------------

- heavily updated the visual sector analyzer (added the paint mode and remember
  for object mode, made it display the coordinates in a more proper way (right
  to left, up to down since it's the way coords are stored)
- added more error prediction

Release v1.5 - Aug 12 2005
--------------------------

- added the visual sector analyzer tool
- made minor code corrections

Release v1.4 - Aug 9 2005
-------------------------

- added TONS of new and updated protos.tab fields, thanks to Sapricon.
- added new properties to object editor: item worth, item weight, NPC reach,
NPC teleport destination/map, NPC standpoints. ONF_WANDERS can also make the
creature wander around its standpoint randomly within 4 tiles (at least it was
so in Arcanum).

Release v1.3 - Aug 7 2005
-------------------------

- added a NPC waypoint editor. In order to make the NPC use the defined waypoints,
  you *must* define the ONF_WAYPOINTS_DAY and/or ONF_WAYPOINTS_NIGHT npc flags!!

Release v1.2 - Aug 6 2005
-------------------------

- all bugfixes that were released after v1.1 as hot updates are included.
- corrected the way static object extraction works: now, if the file with the
  certain GUID already exists, ToEEWB will prompt to overwrite/not overwrite
  that file.

Release v1.1 - Jul 30 2005
--------------------------

- added some more previously unknown entry descriptions to prototype editor.
- added a new mode to the sector editor: static object manager. Using this mode
  you can view a list of embedded static objects, extract any static object and
  save it as a .mob to edit it later and re-embed, and delete static objects
  from sectors.
- added *a lot* of properties to the object editor (check them out! the mobile
  object editor is now a lot more powerful than before!)
- updated ToEE Editor's Assistant Script to version 3.0. Please read the manual.
- completely rewrote the compatibility system. Now you can attempt to load any
  MOB file, including the ones from the game, but if the editor can't yet handle
  the file you will be told about that and the loading will be canceled.
- updated the GUID/object ID generation system that now generates a lot more
  unique identifiers for mobile and static objects.
- Important: added a new switch in configuration (extended ToEE .mob compati-
  bility mode). This mode aims at creating more compatible files for the game
  so that two different objects have a much much smaller chance to overlap
  each other in the game memory. 
- added a smart patcher for proto field names. Newly discovered proto fields
  can easily be added via modification of "ToEE World Builder.pfr" file (use
  any text editor to edit it).
- added two new tutorials: creating secret doors and creating areas with water.
- removed a useless switch "remove GUID after saving" in the object embedding
  window (it stopped being useful back in public beta 1 patchlevel 3 when the
  sector GUID type became autodetectable).
- extra error prediction for loading incompatible mobile objects into the object
  editor. Now, in case a critical error occurs while loading an incompatible .mob
  file, an error message will be given stating that the loading cannot continue
  to avoid data corruption, and the .mob loading will be canceled.
- added a lot of extra error prediction to mob loading/saving routines.
- fixed the position of obj_f_dispatcher field in a mobile object structure.
- fixed a minor bug in description comment detection that very rarely caused
  the description to end up at a wrong line in the mes file (it's no biggie, but
  I decided to fix it anyway).

Release v1.0 - Jul 26 2005
--------------------------

- rewrote the tile editor to support all existing wall/passability flags.
- added support for SVB (sector visibility blocking) files to the tile editor.
- added support for HSD (negative height/water tiles) files to the tile editor.
- added a light editor mode to the sector editor (still very limited and stuff
  is mostly unknown there, plus it can only edit just a couple types of light
  (though it can be enough for most modding tasks).
- added a global lighting (global.lit) editor to the Map Properties tab. It's
  still limited since not all fields are known (well, all fields can be edited,
  but a lot of them are marked as "unknown").
- added more properties to the object editor: model scale, Z offset, hit points,
  hit points damage, speed (walk and run), and door/portal lock DC/key ID/flags.
- added an "area cleaner" mode to map properties editor - a tool that will
  assist getting rid of original map information when developing your own
  maps.
- updated the map.prp editor: excluded the previously unknown entry which has
  proven to be non-existent (art/ground.mes reference is now 64bit as it's
  supposed to be).
- added a configuration option to either save empty svb/hsd files to disk or to
  remove them in case they become empty (set to "don't save" by default).
- added an editor assistant script to the "tools" (it's a Python script for the
  game that simplifies the task of finding out game coordinates and teleporting
  to different locations). NOTE: it's a different version than the one that was
  released as a standalone script. Make sure you read the manual!
- made some clarifications and additions to the prototype editor.
- added a new tutorial: creating invisible mobile objects that spawn particle-
  based special FX.
- added some more documents so that end users can get a good grip on the editor
  a lot faster.
- modified the installation documentation a little (to be more specific).
- added some new sections to the huge module building tutorial.
- updated ToEE Frontend Professional distributed with ToEEWB to v3.0 Release.
- modified the way description.mes is saved in order to make sure that the
  comments are post-parsed and saved correctly every time.
- increased the error prediction level in mob loading/saving routine.
- made a check for sector coordinate legality (so they don't go far beyond
  allowed values).
- fixed a rare, but serious bug in memory cleanup routine that caused sectors
  to become corrupt sometimes (if a sector editor was used for a long time and
  several sec files were loaded and saved back to disk).
- fixed a cruel bug that led to corruption of data in sectors with incompatible
  (unknown yet) light structures.
- fixed a potential crash: it's now impossible to add a description with ID
  lesser than 20000 without adding a corresponding prototype first (to prevent
  in-game and editor errors).
- fixed a potential crash: 2D map recombiner would crash if a file was found 
  with incorrectly formatted file name (now such file names are ignored).
- fixed a bug in the DLL editor that caused the console debug output to be
  enabled every time a DLL is loaded, no matter its state in the library.
- fixed some minor bugs in description editor.
- clarified certain message boxes and window texts.
- modified credits screen to include all people who helped me with the project.
- added icons to both TOEEWB and TOEEFE.
- minor code modifications to remove certain internal inconsistencies (probably
  won't make a lot of sense to end users).

RC1 - Jul 17 2005
-----------------

- corrected some mistypes in window texts and message boxes.
- updated the tile editor a little bit.
- fixed some very minor bugs.
- added a comprehensive module building tutorial.     
- now ToEEWB comes with both ToEE Front-end v2.2 Simple Edition and the new
  ToEE Front-end v3.0RC1 Professional Edition that has support for multiple
  modules on a single ToEE installation.

Beta R2 - Jul 12 2005
---------------------

- added the "tile editor" mode to the sector editor. It allows a modder to
  modify footstep sounds for different coordinates, and also create blocked
  (impassable) areas that either obstruct or don't obstruct player's vision.
- various minor modifications, mainly to remove internal code inconsistencies.
- updated ToEE Frontend included with this version of the ToEEWB to version 2.2
  (read about the updates in the corresponding thread)
- now ToEEWB comes with all the tutorials that were released.

Beta R1.3 - Jul 10 2005
-----------------------

- modified the sector saving routine to attempt the prevention of a memory leak
  bug with sectors. Technically ToEEWB now uses a 'safer' type 0x00 GUID for
  sector memory allocation instead of the previously used type 0x02 GUID which
  seems to work well only for mobile (mob) objects.

Beta R1.2 - Jul 9 2005
----------------------

- added proper credits, both to the editor itself and to whatsnew.txt
- modified the container load/save routine. NOTE: The container/NPC mob files
  will now be auto-saved when you add or remove items to them! This is done to
  prevent accidental data corruption.
- updated the loading routine to detect duplicate entries in description.mes
  and long_description.mes and provide an error message instead of crashing the
  loader (which used to lead to critical errors if the crash message was ignored)
- modified the tab/mes loader so that it doesn't fail to load prototypes EVEN
  if duplicate entries are found in tab/mes files.
- IMPORTANT: modified some aspects of compatibility system when saving MOB and
  SEC files. This could lead to less errors when saving mob/sec files. However,
  the side effect of this is that all MOB files created with previous betas of
  ToEEWB will be marked as INCOMPATIBLE. However, it's still OK to open them
  in the forced mode (you won't encounter any problems).
- now ToEE World Builder comes together with the new version of ToEE Front-end
  (version 2.0). I added support for Drifter's Max HP patch in version 2.0.

Beta R1.1 - Jul 9 2005
----------------------

- fixed a bug in the sector autodetect routine that failed on larger maps
- fixed a bug with sector coordinates not being displayed correctly
- disabled certain debug functions (should make the editor a little faster)
- disabled a confusing debug menu that sometimes could cause crashes if used

Beta R1 - Jul 7 2005
--------------------

- initial public beta release
